# smart-home-health-system

In this project, we utilize the integration of
IoT and cloud technologies to create an efficient and secure
home health monitoring system. Leveraging an ESP-8266 board
and a DHT-11 sensor for temperature and humidity data
collection, the system utilizes AWS IoT core for seamless
data transmission to the cloud. The collected data is refined 
and transformed using AWS Lambda then stored in DynamoDB, 
providing a centralized repository accessible for analysis and visualization. This comprehensive
approach enhances the capabilities of home health monitoring,
enabling real-time insights into the indoor environment. The
projecet shows the system architecture, implementation details,
and potential applications, emphasizing the significance of cloudbased
IoT solutions in advancing personalized and effective home
healthcare.
